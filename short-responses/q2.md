# Question

What are environment variables? How do you access them in Node?

# Answer

These are hidden variables stored in a `.env` file that lives on the host, a `.env` file is also a great place to store your API key. We access them by importing the environment variables from `.env` usinf the dotenv module from npm

```bash
npm i dotenv
```

and within the server Javascript, we can write:

```js
const dotenv = require("dotenv");
dotenv.config();

// or just

require("dotenv").config();

// we can access the value using process.env

console.log(process.env.API_KEY); // abc123
```
