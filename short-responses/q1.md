# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer

Making an API request from the frontend makes it possible for someone to get a hold of your API key and steal your request and resources from it, in order to avoid this, we make API request from the server so that that the API key isn't public.
